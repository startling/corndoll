Here's how I installed bochs on OS X, 2015/11/11:

#+BEGIN_SRC
wget 'http://iweb.dl.sourceforge.net/project/bochs/bochs/2.6.8/bochs-2.6.8.tar.gz'
open bochs-2.6.8.tar.gz
cd bochs-2.6.8
./configure --with-sdl --with-term --enable-gdb-stub --enable-disasm \
            --enable-x86-64 --enable-a20-pin --enable-fpu --enable-readline
make
make install
#+END_SRC

I tried installing homebrew/x11/bochs, but I don't think I want the
x11 version over sdl? I got "PANIC - Cannot connect to X display",
despite having x11 installed, anyway.

Still cribbed some stuff from [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-x11/blob/master/bochs.rb][the homebrew recipe]].
